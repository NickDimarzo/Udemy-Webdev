CSS Units

Relative and Absolute

Absolute
- most common is the pixel
- dont use anything else

Relative

Percentages
- always relative to some other value
- somtimes from the parent 
- sometimes from the element itself
- most commonly used with height and width

em 
relative to font-size of the parent
- with the font-size, 1em equals the font-size of the parent.
- 2em is twice the font-size of the parent.
- with other properties 1em is equal to the computed font-size of the elements itself
- will always use the font size.

common issue with em: they stack, prime example would be nested lists


rems
relative to the root html elements font-size |<html lang="en">|
- often easier to work with
- if the root font-size is 20px
- 1rem is always 20px, 2rem is always 40px
